## Research, Analysis and Evaluation Branch (RAEB) Evidence Updates

The COVID-19 Evidence Update is produced weekly by the Research,
Analysis and Evaluation Branch (RAEB) in the Ministry of Health. The
aim of the Evidence Update is to present up-to-date, curated evidence
about COVID-19 and the response to the pandemic.

The Evidence Update contains summaries of evidence products developed
by [RAEB's] research partners and/or by the Evidence Synthesis Unit,
curated research and jurisdictional information that may be of
interest to staff, and links to trusted sources of information about
COVID-19.
